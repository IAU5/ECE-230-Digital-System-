## üéØ Course Objectives
- **Mastering Fundamental Concepts** in digital system design: Boolean algebra, state diagrams, logic circuits.
- **Proficiency in HDLs** (e.g., Verilog) for high-level digital design.
- **Hands-on Experience with PLDs** via lab work using FPGA boards.
- **System-Level Design & Optimization**: Focused on power, speed, and area efficiency.
- **Project-Based Learning** to foster real-world problem-solving and teamwork.
- **Understand the AI/ML/DL Hardware Landscape**: Develop a hardware-centric understanding of AI, ML, and deep learning models, differentiating between embedded and cloud-based systems.
- **Analyze and Implement AI Models**: Gain hands-on experience coding deep learning models (e.g., VGG19, MobileNetV2) using Python and PyTorch for computer vision tasks, with performance metrics such as accuracy, latency, and memory utilization.
- **Optimize Models for Edge Devices**: Apply model-level optimization techniques such as matrix decomposition, pruning, quantization-aware training (QAT), knowledge distillation, and shifter-algorithms to enhance deployment on low-power hardware.
- **Evaluate Hardware Performance**: Learn to assess hardware efficiency using roofline analysis, performance metrics, and hardware-aware dataflow paradigms for ML accelerators.
- **Utilize Advanced ML Compilation Techniques**: Explore ML compilers, kernel transformations (e.g., Winograd, FFT), and domain-specific compilation strategies for efficient inference on specialized hardware.
- **Build and Deploy TinyML Applications**: Design end-to-end ML pipelines, from data preprocessing to deployment, and deploy models using EdgeImpulse and TinyML microcontrollers for real-time edge inference.
- **Address Societal and Ethical Implications**: Reflect on ethical, environmental, and societal challenges in AI deployment, including federated learning and distributed training paradigms.
